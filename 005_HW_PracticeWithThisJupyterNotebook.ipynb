    "| Metalica | ONE | The perfect rock band needs the greatest rock song. The tone, the emotion and feeling of the song is a new level of rock. It's a very dark story yet executed perfectly. |\n",
    "| Frank Sinatra | My Way | His voice, the tone and everything is perfect. The song as well is one of the greatest songs ever made. He tells the story of his life and how everything was on his terms and no one else's which is how I intent to live and hopefully everyone else as well. |\n",
    "| Foo Fighters | Everlong | This song is sad yes, but the feel of nostlgia I get from this song is crazy. I love the beat, the lyrics, and the backstory on why it was made makes it perfect. It brings back some good memories and Dave Grohl says it in the song as well with \"If everything could ever feel this good again\". I highly reccomend this song if you haven't heard it before. |\n",
    "| EMINEM | Lose Yourself | He is the greatest Rap artists ever and this is his best song. I grew up listening to him and continue to listen to him here and there. The motivation I get from this song is perfect. I want to get lost in the music and get lose in the rythum.| \n",
    "| Alter Bridge | Metalingus | I first heard this song while wathcing WWE growing up and it was made for my favorite WWE star THE RATED R SUPER STAR EDGE. Its already an amazing rock song but knowing it's from WWE and my favorite superstar's song makes it better (he didn't actually sing it but when he would be introduced this played) | \n"
